# Genetic Painter: a genetic algorithm evolving pictures

![The Mona Lisa in 150 triangles](artwork/mona_gen.png)

Straight-forward C implementation of a genetic algorithm with crossover and
mutation, using OpenGL to render each individual as an overlap of triangles.

The main goal of this project was to experiment with different parameters and
find a good way to encode pictures into DNA strings, therefore the performance
is quite poor.
